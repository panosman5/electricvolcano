        Volcanic eruptions affect the Earthâ€™s climate by altering radiation balance through the injection of aerosols in the stratosphere. 
        Conventional knowledge assumes that volcanic influences on climate are mediated by sulfate aerosols only. Recent space-based measurements, 
        however, have challenged this assumption by providing definite evidence that the stratospheric aerosol layer is actually a mixture of sulfates 
        and ash for many months after the eruption. This project aims to understand the unknown processes responsible for the prolonged residence time 
        of the volcanic ash in the stratosphere and to assess its climatic impact. Our main hypothesis is that electric charges of the volcanic plume 
        are responsible for keeping volcanic ash aloft. Charge separation in the volcanic plume induces a local electric field and a force that counteracts 
        the ash particle weight, thus reducing its settling velocity and prolonging its lifetime. ElectricVolcano will combine state-of-art remote sensing 
        techniques, detailed aerosol charging theories and comprehensive atmospheric modelling to provide for the first time a thorough assessment of the 
        impact of electrification on the life cycle of volcanic ash in the stratosphere. Through cutting edge inter-interdisciplinary research, the project 
        produces a step change in the way volcanic eruptions are treated by modelling centers and inter-comparison studies, with the potential to significantly 
        reduce uncertainties in natural forcing and near-term predictions. Carefully-designed research and training activities, combined with the world-class 
        excellence on aerosol-electrification research of the Host Institute, guarantee the success of the proposed project. ElectricVolcano provides new knowledge, 
        tools and resources to the Experienced Researcher for expanding significantly his research horizon and boosting his professional independence.
